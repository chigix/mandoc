Your swiss-army knife to convert documents in Markdown to PDF or HTML.

## Features

This project is inspired by

* [markdown-pdf](https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf)
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* [DeckTape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape)
* [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)

## Quick Start

[ManDoc Document](./packages/mandoc/README.md)

## To Try

* tsconfig file series practice
  It seems that `esm5` and `esm2015` compiling result from typescript source
  code could be directly used for the keys, [`module`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module)
  and `es2015`,  in `package.json` file.

  This practice could also be totally referenced in `rxjs` official repository,
  where different tsconfig files are prepared for compiling target as `es5` and
  `es2015`.

  This attempt sounds that a little time would be cost without any apparent technical
  barrier that need to spend time for inspecting and learning.
